These are some of the things we plan to look at (sooner or later, that is!). Please note that this is only a rough explanation, there's no guarantee that things will be implemented and, if they are, there's no guarantee they will implemented *exactly* as they are outlined here.

You've been warned!

****** FIX BUGS! (fixing bugs is always a priority)

****** Implement XAPI for AS3/AIR!

****** Investigate if find and dir /S is faster than current search

****** Stop protecting the developer when passing null to File.isFile and to Folder.isFolder. Nicolas is probably right : )

****** API addition: xa.Folder.copyAsync(), xa.File.copyAsyc(), xa.Search.searchAsync()

	Some file system operations can be lengthy so it might be handy keeping a responsive application. Ideally, there will be some kind of callback with information about the state of the process (think "copied 12/456" kind of thing).

****** Discuss throwing custom-strong-type exceptions when problems arise.

****** Unit testing
