Some TODO items, in no particular order:

* Warn the user if is using a debug version of the player, has a noticeable impact.
* Reporting:
	* Test results
	* Technical device info that is not privacy related (ie: no IMEI, phone number, etc)
* Documentation.
* Being able to load an external SWF and run tests compiled in it (so people can easily extend the tests)
